As a developer with a passion for creating exceptional user experiences, I've spent the last few years immersed in the world of web and mobile development. 

My primary focus has been on the frontend, where I've honed my skills in React and Typescript. These technologies have been the cornerstone of my work, enabling me to craft beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly applications.

In addition to my expertise in React and Typescript, I'm equally comfortable working with a range of related technologies and frameworks, including React Native, NEXT, NUXT, and VUE3. This versatility has allowed me to take on a variety of projects, from web applications to mobile apps, ensuring that users receive the best digital experiences possible.

Outside of the coding world, I love to embrace the great outdoors. When the weather is on my side, you can often find me on a stand-up paddleboard, soaking in the sun and the serenity of the beach. There's something about the connection between nature and creativity that resonates with me. It's where I find inspiration and balance for my work.

My approach to problem-solving is rooted in breaking down complex challenges into smaller, manageable parts. I've found that by dissecting a problem into its fundamental components, I can not only simplify the issue but also unearth its core. This methodical approach helps me identify the root causes and address them effectively.

Developing for me isn't just a job; it's a continuous journey of learning, creating, and problem-solving. I'm fueled by the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles and the excitement of turning ideas into functional, elegant solutions.
